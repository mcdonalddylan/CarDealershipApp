# CarDealershipApp

Associates will create a CLI for a car dealership program. Customers should be able to log in and make 
offers on cars on the lot, look at the payments they have left on cars, and view the remaining cars on 
the lot. Employees should be able to add cars to the lot, accept or reject offers on cars, and view all 
the payments from a customer.
